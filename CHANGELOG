----------
* added parameter to concepts.location.coordinate constructor; this change effects
the location attribute latitude and longitude (since changed as well)
* removed parameter from concepts.location.coordinates.toSexigesimal (no longer needed now that
type is specified)
* added exception to coordinate constructor when validation of the
coordinate l is not within range; latitude φ {-90 > φ > 90}, longitude λ {-180 > λ > 180}
* added test directory with junit testing support
* added boundary testing of concepts.location.isValid(double, type)
* added test of concepts.location.toSexigesimal for hemisphere in string
* added tests of concepts.location.coordinate constructor (both valid and invalid testing)
